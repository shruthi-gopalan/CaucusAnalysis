# CaucusAnalysis
# The main goal for this question was to get a better understanding of what the distribution of the iowa caucus results dataset looked like, including looking at any patterns that may have been ocurring between people of different demographic qualities. I chose to look at the three demographic qualities of race, income, and age, as I thought these would best represent any patterns in the dataset. For all three qualities I found the counties of Iowa with the highest percentage of people of different groups of race, income, and age, and plotted the sum of their votes for each candidate in the first round. The results I obtained from the plots were representative of the results that can be found online of similar distribution patterns. The only slightly unexpected result was that those of old age were choosing to vote for Sanders more than we had expected due to most age trends in voting throughought the country.
